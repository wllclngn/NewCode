Output all updated files. If you update a file, respect its original version. If commenting, code itself, logging, ERROR handling, etc., exists, do not simply delete. Incorporate your changes into my files.

1) Configurable File Naming Conventions (part of Req 4): While directories are configurable, the actual names of intermediate files (e.g., partition_*.txt), the final aggregated output (e.g., final_results.txt), and the SUCCESS.txt file are hardcoded and not configurable by the user.

2) Controller Assigning Input Files to Mappers (Req 5a): The controller logic currently does not show how input files from the inputDir are distributed among the multiple mapper processes. The runMapper function is called with an empty list of input files.

3) Reducers Starting Before All Mappers Complete (Req 5c): The current implementation explicitly waits for all mapper processes/threads to finish before starting any reducer processes, which contradicts this requirement (though it fulfills Req 3).

4) Controller Executing a Distinct Sorting Step (Req 5d): The controller does not execute a separate sorting step. While sorting occurs within the reducer (as per Req 6), this specific requirement for the controller to "execute the sorting" is marked as not met in your MapReduceExeERRORS.md and isn't apparent in the controller's logic.
